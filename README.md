# pybuzz
A FizzBuzz training kata, in python and pytest.

## Train yourself!
FizzBuzz is a simple problem with many solutions: when given a number 'n', the program should return:
* 'Fizz' if n is divisible by 3;
* 'Buzz' if n is divisible by 5;
* 'FizzBuzz' if n is divisible by both 3 and 5; and
* 'n' if n is not divisible by 3, 5 or both.

This simple task is a fun way to start the day - try different solutions, or try to reach the same solution in a shorter time.  Can your solution be refactored? Does a shorter solution always mean better code?
